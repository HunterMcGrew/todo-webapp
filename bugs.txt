when marking items as complete under "Active" they stay there

when marking multiple items as completed under "Active" they go away out of order
and buggy

can't unmark a completed item under "Active", clikcing it a second time relaod
the logic and makes it disapear

*Makes me think everything is firing too fast?*

when deleting a single compelted item under "Completed" it doesn't disapear
